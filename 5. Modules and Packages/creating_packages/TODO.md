# Create the package
1. Create a package within this directory called 'operations'.
2. Create two modules within the package named 'math_operations' and 'string_operations'. (You may reuse the 'math_operations' module from the previous scenario.)

# Define string_operations module
1. Define a function 'concatenate' that takes two strings and returns their concatenation.
2. Define a function 'difference' that takes two strings and returns the result of removing all of the letters present in the second string from the first string. For example: difference("elephant", "pear") should return the string 'lhnt'
3. Define a function 'all_differences' that takes a list of strings, calculates the difference between every pair of strings in the list, then returns those differences a 2D list
